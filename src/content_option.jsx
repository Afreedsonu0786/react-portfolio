Hello there üëã I‚Äôm Shaheed Afridi Mohammed, a Full-Stack Developer specializing in React.js, Next.js, and Node.js, with a passion for TypeScript.

I‚Äôve honed my skills at Mindtree and Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale . My key projects include:
- HealthCare Compass: a app with geolocation & cost-based recommendations  
- Chat Friendly: a real-time chat platform powered by Socket.io  
- E-commerce Platform: An AI-powered e-commerce platform (in progress), featuring smart recommendations and an admin dashboard  

I hold a Master‚Äôs in Information Systems from Saint Louis University, I focused on data-driven decision support and crafting modern web applications with intuitive UI's.

When I‚Äôm not coding:
- I‚Äôm debugging with a hot cup of coffee in hand ‚òï  
- Perfecting my signature spicy biryani recipe ü•ò  
- Exploring new hiking trails (and sometimes taking the scenic detour) üèûÔ∏è  

I believe in writing clean, maintainable, and purpose-driven code preferably before my coffee goes cold!
